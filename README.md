Line Follower Robot using Atmega32

Description:  simple Line follower robot using Atmega32.
The idea behind this robot is to detect black line using 2 IR sensors and move robot accordingly using L293D motor driver module to control the movement of the motor and directions,   
and  use pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the speed of the motor.

Drivers: (IR sensor, GPIO, Motor Driver IC L293D , Timer, UART, and DC-Motor).

Microcontroller: ATmega32
